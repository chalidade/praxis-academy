Common Kernel Option
This list is not comprehensive but it contain some common bot option which may be added to the end of the boot command

1. vga=xxx
Set your framebuffer resolution to VESA mode xxx. Check here for a list of possible modes.

2. acpi=off OR noacpi
This parameter disables the whole ACPI system. This may prove very useful, for example, if your computer does not support ACPI or if you think the ACPI implementation might cause some problems (for instance random reboots or system lockups).

3. acpi=force
Activates the ACPI system even if your computer BIOS date is older than 2000. This parameter overrides acpi=off and can also be used with current hardware if the ACPI support is not activated despite apm=off.

4. pci=noacpi OR acpi=noirq
These parameters disable the PCI IRQ routing

5. pci=acpi
This parameter activates the PCI IRQ routing

6. acpi_irq_balance
ACPI is allowed to use PIC interrupts to minimize the common use of IRQs.

7. acpi_irq_nobalance
ACPI is not allowed to use PIC interrupts.

8. acpi=oldboot
Deactivates the ACPI system almost completely; only the components required for the boot process will be used.

9. acpi=ht
Deactivates the ACPI system almost completely; only the components required for hyper threading will be used.

10. noapic
Disable the "Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC)".

11. nolapic
Disable the "local APIC".

12. apm=off OR noapm
Disable the Advanced Power Management.

13. irqpoll
Changes the way the kernel handles interrupt calls (set it to polling). Can be useful in case of hardware interrupt issues.

14. acpi.power_nocheck=1 OR acpi_osi=Linux
Disable the check of power state. Option two modifies the list of supported OS interface strings (changes the OS compatibility reported to the BIOS). Necessary on some broken BIOSes to make temperature/fan control work.
